## What the acronym "GTC" stand for ?

Keeped from an idea in French, "Gestionnaire de Tables de Convention" aka "Convention Table Manager" : an basic concept idea for a management software for TableTop RPG (TTRPG, "JdR" or "Jeu de Rôle" in french, sometimes labelled "Jeu de Rôle sur table"), to simply manage Table, Games, Game Masters and Players in a Gaming Convention where TTPRG is played.
